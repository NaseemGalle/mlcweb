    <h2>Short History Of Muslim Ladies College</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        A fragment of the history of Muslim girls It started with 17 students from Thalapitiya village of Galle Municipality in 1918. 
        Then the school was a mixed school and Tamil and English medium students were engaged in learning and teaching process. 
        On 01.03.1965, this school became a separate school for boys and girls.The existing two-day school system was transformed into 
        a one-day school.</p> 
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Ga/Malharus Sulhia Girls' School, which was reserved for girls only, was removed from its location on Circular Road and established at a site about 250 meters away from Kongaha Junction on Galle Baddegama Road. 
        Then the number of female students were 750. 
        Today, the number of students in the school has grown to under 1700. I am happy to say that due to the hard work and dedication of the college and the school community, it has become a prestigious school.
